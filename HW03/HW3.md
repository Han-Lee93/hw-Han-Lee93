# Homework 03

#### You will analyze data looking at the relationship between **green reputation** and three personality traitsâ€“**compassion**, **intellectual curiosity**, and **openness to experiences**.

The dataset includes data from **students** and **non-students**.

## For your assignment, do the following.

### Q1: Inspect the item responses (e.g., with graphs or by summarizing distinct values).

``` r
# Is anything unusual?

filter(green_data, id == 5549) #Searches id for value "5549" 
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 37
    ##   id    green1 green2 green3 green4 green5 comp1 comp2 comp3 comp4 comp5 comp6
    ##   <chr>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 5549       3      4      4      4      3     4     2     4     4     4     4
    ## 2 5549       4      2      4      3      4     4     5     4     5     5     1
    ## # ... with 25 more variables: comp7 <dbl>, comp8 <dbl>, comp9 <dbl>,
    ## #   comp10 <dbl>, intel1 <dbl>, intel2 <dbl>, intel3 <dbl>, intel4 <dbl>,
    ## #   intel5 <dbl>, intel6 <dbl>, intel7 <dbl>, intel8 <dbl>, intel9 <dbl>,
    ## #   intel10 <dbl>, open1 <dbl>, open2 <dbl>, open3 <dbl>, open4 <dbl>,
    ## #   open5 <dbl>, open6 <dbl>, open7 <dbl>, open8 <dbl>, open9 <dbl>,
    ## #   open10 <dbl>, student <dbl>

``` r
#Quick summary check
green_data.melt <- melt(green_data, measures.var = across(c:green1:open10)) #Reformat dataset, sets all columns into 1 column to separate as factors
```

    ## Using id as id variables

``` r
ggplot(green_data.melt) +
  aes(y = value,
      x = id
      ) +
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2930 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

### Q4: Make plots that illustrate the distributions of the 4 POMP-scored variables.

``` r

``` r

#One possiblity is that these scales are positively correlated to one another.

#Additionally, the graph shows that there are more low total score values for green than the rest.
```

``` r
# Based only from the graphs, there seem to be a potential positive correlation between the green trait survey and each of the other personality trait surveys. 
#Additionally the graphs show interactions between the green survey and both intel personality trait survey and the open personality trait survey. 
#When comparing the scores between student, non-student and people who did not answer (no response), there is a difference in the scaling and scores between the people who did not respond and those who did.
#Those who did not respond seem to show a lower total score value for all of the personality traits but higher scaling (i.e., larger increase in personality trait total score value per total score value for the green survey).

### Q6: Compare **green reputation** for students and non-students using a **rainfall plot** (bar + density + data points).

``` r
ggplot(data = subset(Q5set.2, 
                          !is.na(student)
                     )
       ) +
  aes(x = Total_green, 
      fill = student,
      group = student,
      alpha = student,
      color = student
      ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", 
                                "blue"
                               )
                     ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red2",
                               "aquamarine"
                               )
                    ) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity",
                 binwidth = 1.5,
                 aes(y = ..density.., 
                     alpha = .4
                     )
                 ) +
  geom_density(alpha = .2)
```

#Overall, the plot does not seem to indicate a notable difference between students and non-students for the green reputation scale.

### Q7: Compute a summary table of means, SDs, medians, minima, and maxima for the four total scores for students and non-students.

``` r
Q5set.1 %>%
  group_by(student) %>% 
  summarize(across(c(Total_green:Total_open),
                    list(Mu = ~ mean(.x,
                                      na.rm = TRUE
                                     ),
                         Sigma = ~ sd(.x,
                                      na.rm = TRUE
                                     ),
                         Median = ~ median(.x,
                                           na.rm = TRUE
                                           ),
                         Max = ~ max(.x, 
                                     na.rm = TRUE
                                     ),
                         Min = ~ min(.x, 
                                     na.rm = TRUE
                                     )
                         )
                   )
            )
```

#Judging purely by the summary statistics, there does not seem to be a difference between students and non-students for any of the personality trait scores (with the possible exception for the mean total score value for comp) or the green reputation scores. 
#Nearly all the means between the two groups are the same and around 70 for the scores, with the exception of comp (76-81) and green (65-67)

In your assignment, prepare an RMarkdown file that includes both the
coding and (for 4-7) narrative descriptions of your results.
