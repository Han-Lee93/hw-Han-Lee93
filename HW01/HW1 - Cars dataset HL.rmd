## HW1 Assignment

Dataset used: cars

Details regarding dataset cars
```{r Cars}
colnames(cars) <- c("Speed","Dist")
cars
str(cars)
summary(cars)
# Creating mean for speed in car data.
speedmean=mean(cars$Speed)
distmean=mean(cars$Dist)
overallmean=rbind(speedmean,distmean)
```

## Plots
```{r Plots, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x=Speed,Dist)) +
  geom_point(aes(Speed))
plot(overallmean)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
