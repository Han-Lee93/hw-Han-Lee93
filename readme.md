## Introduction - About Me

I am currently a 4th year graduate student at the University of South Florida. I am from Ohio and I got my B.S. at the Ohio State University.

## Research Interests

<img src="https://github.com/usf-progdata/hw-Han-Lee93/blob/master/Images/Slide16.PNG" width="250" height="250" align="right"> 

My area of research is in _**cognitive psychology**_. More specifically, I am interested in _**visual perception**_ and _**attention**_. How do people perceive objects? Many real-world objects possess multiple levels of perceivable information. For example, one level of a car is simply perceiving the car itself while another level is the doors or the color of the car. Additionally, these levels are perceived at different times. My research looks at the time course of multi-level object perception and how attention influences this time course. To examine multi-level object perception, my studies utilize stimuli known as Navon Letters or Hierarchical letters (see right).
